FLICKERSCAPE is an interactive audio visual artpiece based in the web browser.  It was created by Christopher Lock in 2020
and was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It uses the Web Audio API and the HTML audio tag for all of the sounds and
CSS animations and JavaScript for the visuals.  FLICKERSCAPE is currently not mobile freindly and for optimal experience
headphones are recomended.  It was created as an attempt to turn the practice of experimental audio mixing into a kind
of game.

To begin: open up a terminal window in the CS50 IDE and make sure you cd into the project/ folder.  Once you are currently in project/, run
the following command:

http-server

Once run, a link will appear that should resemble something like the following:

https://1cbcd079-7060-4303-a915-14696b88a115-ide.cs50.xyz:8080

Click this link and it will take you to a new page titled Index of/.
This displays all of the files that make FLICKERSCAPE run.  From this page simply click on index.html and you will
be directed to the FLICKERSCAPE homepage.  Once you have arrived on the homepage you will notice two different elements;
the title: FLICKERSCAPE (which flickers red every couple of seconds), and an "about" tab to the upper left of the screen.
Hover over the about tab if you would like to read more about the project.  If you are ready to start playing simply click on
the title.  You will first be redirected to a strobe warning (which is not at all a joke so be warned), then after 4 seconds the
piece will begin.

Your objective/role in this audiovisual artpiece will be more than that of a mere audince member.  Your goal will be to move
your curser around the FLICKERSCAPE in search of rectangles that turn red when you hover over them.  When you click these rectangles
new sounds will be added to the sonic texture and the rectangle will minimize until you have found and clicked another one!  But
be warned, it is intentionally difficult to locate/acurately click these buttons while the rest of the grid is moving around.  Also, the layout
of the FLICKERSCAPE will change every 10 seconds make it even more difficult to navigate.  Each new layout can be thought of as a new scene so
to speak.  If it wasn't hard to click them then it wouldn't be as rewarding and wouldn't be as fun, right?
Clicking the buttons that you find makes you just as much the artist/composer of the piece as I am since you ultimately have much of
the control over what the aesthetic outcome of the experience will be.

When you are done playing simply close the tab and all audio will stop.
